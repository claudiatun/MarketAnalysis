# MarketAnalysis
Sales analytics is the practice of generating insights from sales data, trends, and metrics to set targets and forecast future sales performance. Sales analysis is mining your data to evaluate the performance of your sales team against its goals. It provides insights about the top performing and underperforming products/services, the problems in selling and market opportunities, sales forecasting, and sales activities that generate revenue. In this project, target market analysis, an assessment of how your product or service fits into a specific market and where it will gain the most will be performed.
